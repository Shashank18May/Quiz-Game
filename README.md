Hello guys, My name is Shashank Tripathi. I created the following project .It is a quiz game that asks you ten questions and at the end displays the results.
It also includes a timer.

If you want to run this code:- 

Just create one new folder with two new files  named as Main and Quiz and save the code respectively.

Compile Main.java with javac Main.java

Then run java Calculator to launch the Quiz-Game.

This program is compatible with any verion of java above JAVA 1.7.5
